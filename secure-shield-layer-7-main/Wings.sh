Creating an advanced DDoS protected script involves several components to handle different layers of protection. Below, I'll outline a basic script that integrates IP tables for firewall rules and Fail2Ban for automated blocking of suspicious traffic. This script assumes you're using Ubuntu or a similar Linux distribution. Please note that DDoS protection can be complex and may require additional measures depending on your specific needs and environment.

### Advanced DDoS Protected Script Outline

#### 1. IP Tables Configuration

IP tables will be configured to block suspicious traffic based on defined rules. Replace `<your_wings_8080_ip>` with your actual server IP address.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Flush existing rules and set default policies
iptables -F
iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -P FORWARD DROP
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

# Allow loopback traffic
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT

# Allow established and related incoming connections
iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

# Allow incoming SSH connections (adjust port if necessary)
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

# Allow incoming HTTP/HTTPS (adjust port if necessary)
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT

# Allow traffic on port 8080 for wings
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8080 -s <your_wings_8080_ip> -j ACCEPT

# Drop invalid packets
iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate INVALID -j DROP

# Log and drop everything else
iptables -A INPUT -j LOG --log-prefix "IPTables-Dropped: " --log-level 4
iptables -A INPUT -j DROP

# Save the rules
iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```

#### 2. Fail2Ban Configuration

Fail2Ban monitors logs and bans IP addresses that show malicious behavior. Create a custom filter and jail configuration for wings on port 8080.

- **Create a filter for wings (e.g., `/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/wings.conf`):**

```ini
[Definition]
failregex = ^<HOST> .* POST .* 8080
ignoreregex =
```

- **Create a jail for wings (e.g., `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/wings.conf`):**

```ini
[wings]
enabled = true
port = 8080
filter = wings
logpath = /var/log/wings/access.log
maxretry = 5
findtime = 3600
bantime = 3600
```

#### 3. Log Rotation

Ensure logs are rotated and managed properly to prevent them from consuming too much disk space and to maintain performance.

#### 4. Monitoring and Response

Monitor server performance and network traffic regularly. Implement automatic alerts for unusual traffic patterns or resource usage spikes.

### Important Considerations

- **Performance Impact:** IP tables and Fail2Ban can impact server performance if not configured properly. Test thoroughly in a controlled environment before deploying to production.
  
- **Regular Updates:** Keep IP tables, Fail2Ban, and your server's software up to date to mitigate vulnerabilities.

- **Additional Protections:** Consider using a content delivery network (CDN), rate limiting, or specialized DDoS protection services for comprehensive defense.

This script provides a foundational setup for protecting a server running wings on port 8080 against DDoS attacks and other malicious traffic. Adjustments may be necessary based on your specific requirements and environment. Always ensure you understand the implications of each rule and configuration change before implementing them.
